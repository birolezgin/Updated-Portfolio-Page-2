# Updated-Portfolio-Page-2

# Description:

I created a portfolio using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This portfolio includes a home page where you can reach out to my Linkedin and Github pages. A projects page where you can reach out to my strongest projects. An about page where you can reach out to my Bio and can download my resume. And a contact page where you can submit your name, email address and message to me.
